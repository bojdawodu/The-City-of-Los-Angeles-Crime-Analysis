### Project Overview
According to Skipp Townsend, a resident of Los Angeles via the Los Angeles Times newspaper, crime in Los Angeles has decreased in 2023 but fear of crime is still up.
One major reason why crime seems to be lower year on year is because certain crimes are not being reported which is an indicator of data challenges per Mr. Townsend.

This project is focused on gaining valuable insights on the crimes in Los Angeles and I obtained the data for this analysis from www.lacity.org.

### Data Source

Crime Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the Los_Angeles_Crime.csv file, containing detailed information about the crime records in Los Angeles during the specified period.
Los Angeles Crime Dataset

### Data Structure

The dataset contained 28 columns and 829,778 rows with headers. There are instances of missing or incomplete values

### Tool

- Microsoft Excel

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
1. Renamed column headers - For easy column identification
2. Treated missing values - Renamed blank values with UNK to simplify analysis and show data gaps during analysis as well as opportunities in the Los Angeles data collection process.
   Blank values were treated in the following columns: Victim_Sex, Victim Descent and Weapon Description
3. Deleted unnecessary columns for the analysis
4. Classified all column data according to their specific data type
5. Included the column names and their respective descriptions

### Data Analysis
I mainly used pivot tables to analyze the dataset as well as charts to visualize my findings in order to enhance the comprehension of my audience.

### Results and Findings
- Los Angeles had the highest number of crimes reported in 2022
- Historically, Q3 has had the highest number of crimes with the exception of 2022
- Identity theft has gained traction as it increased YoY by 107% in 2022
- In 2023, Identity theft takes the No.3 spot on the top 10 crimes in Los Angeles Vehicle thefts retains the No.1 spot
- Crimes outside top 10 also need monitoring
- Central Los Angeles is the area with the highest crime
- Vehicle burglary is the number one crime in central Los Angeles
- Most crimes are committed on the street - Supports the vehicle thefts/burglary insights
- Younger demographics are targeted the most
- Men are most likely to be the victims of crime
- Hispanics are the top targets of crime followed by African-Americans
- Over 90% of the cases are still under investigation

### Summary/Recommendations
Crime is on the rise in Los Angeles and immediate actions need to be taken to improve intelligence gathering, data collection and city patrol.
Investment also must be made to ensure the workforce is sufficient and capable enough for the safety of the residents.
